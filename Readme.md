# bounding-boxes

Keep track of your elements with bounding boxes.

## Install

    npm install --save bounding-boxes

## Usage

### import
```typescript
import { BoundingBox } from 'bounding-boxes';
```

### Useful functions

```typescript
/**
 * The BoundingBox class contains the 2d coordinates of a point,
 * and has some useful functions such as
 *  - `containsPoint(x, y)`
 *  - `intersects(other)`
 *  - `intersection(other)`
 *  - `union(other)`
 *
 * If you wish to modify x1 and x2 simulteanously, use the x property.
 * Same applies for y.
 *
 * Note that the the points are always ordered: x1 is always smaller than x2,
 * and y1 is always smaller than y2.
 *
 * Because of this, height and width are always positive.

```

### Two equivalent boxes
```typescript
// From coordinates        (x1, y1, x2, y2)
let bbox1 = new BoundingBox(10, 10, 20, 20);
// From height and width      (h,  w,  x1, y1)
let bbox2 = BoundingBox.fromHW(10, 10, 10, 10)
```

### some usage...

```typescript
let bbox1 = new BoundingBox(10, 10, 30, 30);
let bbox2 = new BoundingBox(20, 20, 40, 40);

console.log(bbox1.intersects(bbox2));
// true

let union = bbox1.union(bbox2);
//                                   (x1, y1, x2, y2)
console.log(union === new BoundingBox(10, 10, 40, 40));
// true
```
